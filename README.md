# 18-NoSQL-Challenge-Social-Network-API

## Description
This API powers a social network's backend, facilitating the sharing of thoughts, reactions, and friend management. Tailored for social media startups, it uses a NOSQL database, Express.js for routing, MongoDB for storage, and Mongoose ODM for handling large unstructured data. The system includes User and Thought models with corresponding schemas, as well as a Reaction subdocument schema.

Upon activation, the server starts, and Mongoose models sync with the MongoDB database.

Insomnia Core's API GET routes neatly present user and thought data in JSON format. The API's POST, PUT, and DELETE routes effectively handle user and thought operations. Additionally, POST and DELETE routes manage reactions to thoughts and friend list updates.
